# importrc

One command to import your dotfiles from GitHub

WIP

## Usage

Create a repository named `importrc` on your GitHub profile. Add your config
files to it, such as `.bashrc` `.vimrc`. Any files in here will be placed in
your home directory when you run `importrc`.

```bash
importrc bennuttall
```

This downloads the contents of https://github.com/bennuttall/importrc and places
them in the home directory.
